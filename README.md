## Purpose of this repo
The goal of this repo was to create a one stop location for finding and adding books to a personalized reading list. The user can select search criteria and find books by author or title. The search results appear on the webpage and a user may select one or more books to add to their personal bookshelf/library. On the library page a user is able to delete any books they have finished or are no longer interested in. The library page also displays a list of the top 5 best sellers from a randomized list of NY Times best sellers categories.
